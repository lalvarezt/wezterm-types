## Guidelines

### What I Will Not Accept

- **BAD COMMIT MESSAGES**. Please follow the Conventional Commits standard.
  Read [this guide][conventional_commits] to get familiarized with Conventional Commits.
- **UNCREDITED CODE**. If pulling from somewhere else, _**paste the reference URL in a comment**_.
- **AI-GENERATED CODE**. The code here must be up to date and made with effort.
- **MERGE COMMITS**. Use `git rebase` instead, then force-push to your Pull Request.
- **UNSIGNED COMMITS**. Read [this guide][signing_guide] to know how to sign your commits.
  Unsigned commits will be promptly squashed, manually rebased by the author or rejected altogether
  if the occasion warrants it..
- **NON-UNIX LINE ENDINGS**. Make sure to set your config in your CLI:.
  ```bash
  git config --local core.autocrlf false # If you want to enforce this only in this repository
  git config --local core.eol lf

  git config --global core.autocrlf false # If you want to enforce this in your global settings
  git config --global core.eol lf
  ```
  If you're using Neovim set this in your `init.lua`:
  ```lua
  -- init.lua
  vim.o.fileformat = 'unix' -- RECOMMENDED

  vim.opt.fileformat = 'unix' -- AVOID THIS
  ```

### Plugins

If you're a plugin author and you wish to add type annotations for it, please follow these steps
in order:

- Make sure your plugin isn't already listed either in either [README.md](./README.md)
or [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md). If it is, then make a PR to suggest fixes to the existing
annotations.
- Make a new branch, please avoid a PR from your fork's `main` branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feat/PLUGIN-NAME
  ```
- Execute [`scripts/new-plugin.sh`](./scripts/new-plugin.sh) in your shell:
  ```bash
  ./scripts/new-plugin.sh PLUGIN-NAME # ONLY DASHES `-` ALLOWED!
  ```
- Edit your plugin annotations in [`lua/wezterm/types/plugins`](./lua/wezterm/types/plugins). Use
  other plugin's annotations as references, and make sure to read the [Annotations Guide](#annotations-guide)
  section.
- Edit `docs/<MY-PLUGIN>.md`. Use the other plugin docs as reference.
- Add the document mentioned above in [docs/README.md](./docs/README.md). **RESPECT THE ALPHABETIC ORDER**!
- Follow the [Plugin Maintenance](#plugin-maintenance) workflow below to register the plugin,
  regenerate the generated `README.md` table, and run validation.
- Commit then push your changes. Make your PR afterwards.
  - Your commit message must look like this:
    ```
    feat(PLUGIN-NAME): add type annotations
    ```

### Plugin Maintenance

Use this section both when adding a plugin for the first time and when updating an existing one.
This is the source of truth for the plugin manifest, the generated `README.md` table, and the
optional maintenance review pages.

1. Add or update the plugin entry in [`metadata/plugins.json`](./metadata/plugins.json).
   Keep the list alphabetized and set `tracked_ref` to the exact upstream release, tag, or commit
   that you validated against.

2. Regenerate the `README.md` featured plugin table:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh table
   ```
   Do not edit the generated table in `README.md` by hand.

3. Run local validation:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh validate
   ```
   `validate` is local-only. It checks manifest shape, inventory parity, and README table freshness.

4. Generate a fresh maintenance report when you want to compare the tracked refs against upstream
   or refresh the data used by the review page and README status badges:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh sync
   ```
   `sync` requires `gh` authentication and network access. This writes `.tmp/plugin-maintenance/report.json`.

5. Review the existing report:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh review
   ```
   `review` reads the existing `.tmp/plugin-maintenance/report.json`. It does not run `sync` for you.

6. Render the static HTML maintenance site from the existing report:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh render-pages
   ```
   `render-pages` does not run `sync` for you. It only turns the current report into static files under
   `.tmp/plugin-maintenance/pages`.

7. If you want the full HTML report locally, render it and serve it with:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh render-pages --serve
   ```
   This renders the pages from the current report and serves them at
   `http://localhost:9999/plugin-maintenance/` when `python3` or `python` is available.
   You can choose a different port:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/plugin-maintenance.sh render-pages --serve 8000
   ```

8. For each outdated plugin, inspect upstream manually and decide whether the local
   annotations should be updated. For `release` and `tag` entries, compare your docs and types
   against that upstream version. For `commit` entries, `outdated` only means upstream moved on;
   do not bump the tracked commit unless you actually revalidated the annotations against a newer
   upstream commit. If you do bump `tracked_ref`, repeat from step 2.

## Recommendations

**NOTE**: The following recommendations assume that you're using a UNIX shell
(`bash` / `sh` / `zsh` / ...).

### `pre-commit`

I encourage you to use `pre-commit` to run the hooks contained in
[`.pre-commit-config.yaml`](https://github.com/DrKJeff16/wezterm-types/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml).

To install it, follow [these instructions][pre-commit-install] in the `pre-commit` website.
After that, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Now every time you run `git commit` the hooks contained in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` will run.

It is recommended for you to update the hooks if required to:

```bash
pre-commit autoupdate
```

You must then commit the changes to `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

## Annotations Guide

The annotation style is attempting to be more resembling of a LuaCATS style, where possible.
To be concise examples will be given with various situations.

Please respect and follow the annotations style! Willful non-adherance to the annotation style
will result in your PR/Issue being promptly closed!

Here we adhere to documentation as transparent as it can be.

### Types

Prefer setting `---@type` annotations in the same line

```lua
---AVOID
---@type boolean
local x

---CORRECT
local x ---@type boolean
```

An exception can be made if the textwidth grows too much!

```lua
---AVOID
---The textwidth is very big and the types won't fit in the screen
local x, y, z, foo, bar = 1, function() end, true, "bar", nil ---@type integer, function, boolean, string, number|nil

---ACCEPTABLE
---@type integer, function, boolean, string, number|nil
local x, y, z, foo, bar = 1, function() end, true, "bar", nil
```

Also don't use `<type>?` in `---@type` annotations! Please use `<type>|nil` instead!

```lua
---AVOID
local l ---@type string?

---CORRECT
local l ---@type string|nil
```

### Aliases

- Keep aliases to a minimum:

```lua
---PLEASE DON'T DO THIS!

---WRONG
---@alias StringArr string[]
---@alias StringArrDict table<string, StringArr>

---Redundant...
---@alias Foo { foo: 'bar' }
---@alias FooList Foo[]
---...
```

- Avoid redundant aliases at all costs!

```lua
---DON'T DO THIS OH GOD
---@alias MyTable table

---I've seen these types in other projects,
---way more than what my soul can handle...
---@alias Int integer
---@alias Bool boolean
---@alias Str string
```

- If your alias can be turned into a enum, prefer using one:

```lua
---AVOID THIS
---@alias MyChoices
---|"0"
---|"1"
---|"2"
---|"3"
---|"4"
---|"5"
---|"6"
---|"7"
---|"8"
---|"9"
---|"10"
---|"11"
---|"12"
---|"13"
---|"14"
---|"15"
---|"16"
---|"17"
---|"18"
---|"19"
---|"20"
---|"21"
---|"22"
---|"23"
---|"24"
---|"25"
---|"26"
---|"27"
---|"28"
---|"29"
---|"30"
---|"31"
---|"32"
---|"33"

---CORRECT
---Replace the values for whatever you need, if at all.
---@enum (key) MyChoices
local choices = {
  ["0"] = 1,
  ["1"] = 1,
  ["2"] = 1,
  ["3"] = 1,
  ["4"] = 1,
  ["5"] = 1,
  ["6"] = 1,
  ["7"] = 1,
  ["8"] = 1,
  ["9"] = 1,
  ["10"] = 1,
  ["11"] = 1,
  ["12"] = 1,
  ["13"] = 1,
  ["14"] = 1,
  ["15"] = 1,
  ["16"] = 1,
  ["17"] = 1,
  ["18"] = 1,
  ["19"] = 1,
  ["20"] = 1,
  ["21"] = 1,
  ["22"] = 1,
  ["23"] = 1,
  ["24"] = 1,
  ["25"] = 1,
  ["26"] = 1,
  ["27"] = 1,
  ["28"] = 1,
  ["29"] = 1,
  ["30"] = 1,
  ["31"] = 1,
  ["32"] = 1,
  ["33"] = 1,
}
```

- Use brackets in your aliases wisely!

```lua
---Will be parsed as `fun(): (string|string[])`
---@alias ListOrFunction fun(): string|string[]

---Will be parsed as `string[]|fun(): string`
---
---The `fun(): ...` type is a bit funny (AKA a headache)
---@alias ListOrFunction (fun(): string)|string[]
```
